# Random-Forrest-Classifier-and-XGBoost-Hybrid-Ensamble-for-Binary-Classification

<h2>Description</h2>
The primary objective of this notebook is to build an ensemble model that predicts trends, first using an initial dataset and then refining the model with a second dataset. The model also addresses missing data predictions. Throughout this process, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation are performed.
